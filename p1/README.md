## Outside Resources
Image of the card dealer is from the movie [Vegas Vacation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120434/) and was pulled from <http://www.aveleyman.com/Gallery/2017/M/36721-28453.jpg>.

## Notes for instructor
Straight-forward game of guess a number between 1 and 10. A fun feature to add-on would be to start with $10 and choose the wager amount (min bet of $1) and see if you can make all of your losses back!
